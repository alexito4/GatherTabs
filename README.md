# GatherTabs

This script gathers all the open tabs in Safari from remote devices (iOS or OS X) and opens them in the current Mac.

Also check out [srly.swift](https://github.com/alexito4/srly.swift) for more Safari scripts ;)

## WARNING

The script modifies the PLIST with the current Safari session. Make a copy in case something goes wrong or you may lose all your open tabs.

## TODO

- Figure out a way to remove the Tabs form the remote devices. I tried a way but doesn’t seem to work so it’s disabled for now. (code is commented in the script).

# Requirements
- Apple Swift version 2.1.1 (Xcode 7.2.1)
